# [why-zod](https://zod.dev/)

- TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- Runtime library for validating values and shapes in TypeScript.
- Designed to be as developer-friendly as possible. The goal is to eliminate duplicative type declarations. With Zod, you declare a validator once and Zod will automatically infer the static TypeScript type. It's easy to compose simpler types into complex data structures.
- **Zod Schema is our Source Of Types.**

Some other great aspects:

- Zero dependencies
- Works in Node.js and all modern browsers
- Tiny: 8kb minified + zipped
- Immutable: methods (e.g. .optional()) return a new instance
- Concise, chainable interface
- Functional approach: parse, don't validate
- Works with plain JavaScript too! You don't need to use TypeScript.
